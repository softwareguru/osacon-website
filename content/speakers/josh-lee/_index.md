Whether it’s operators or observability, agile or accessibility, my expertise shines because I’m passionate about all of it. I’ve been building software for more than a decade and I love sharing experiences via public speaking. I’m currently a Developer Advocate for Altinity where I help create educational content about ClickHouse® and OpenTelemetry, and I am a contributor to the OpenTelemetry project.
