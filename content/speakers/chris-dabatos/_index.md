Chris Dabatos, developer advocate at TiDB with a focus on distributed databases and helping teams scale without overcomplicating things. He spends a lot of time building demos, speaking at meetups and conferences, and working with open source projects that blend AI and data infrastructure. He’s big on showing, not just telling. So expect real world examples and maybe a few stories about what didn’t work. Outside of work, he runs a YouTube channel, helps organize hackathons, and lives in Las Vegas.
