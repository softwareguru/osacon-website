Evan is a Sr. Developer Advocate with Preset, Inc. and works closely with the Apache Superset community. He's a front-end engineer, engineering manager, and designer. The design and building of data visualizations and user interfaces have been Evan's key interests for over the last several years, but he now spends the bulk of his time growing and engaging with the Superset community, striving to improve the product and its processes along the way. When not working on software, he's a dad, a bassist, a beer judge, and an enthusiast of all things found in a garage.
