Sri Rama Satya Prasanth Vuppuluri is a highly accomplished product and functional manager with over 11 years of cross-functional experience spanning management consulting, software development, human-centered design, and enterprise system modernization. Currently a Manager at Deloitte Consulting LLP, Prasanth leads digital transformation initiatives within the United States Health and Human Services (HHS) domain, delivering high-impact solutions across Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, LIHEAP, and Child Care Assistance programs.
 
In his current role with the Virginia Department of Social Services, he spearheads critical enhancements to the Virginia Case Management System (VaCMS)—the state's flagship integrated eligibility platform. His work includes leading the implementation of SNAP accuracy optimization via automated cross-checks, fiscal policy updates aligned with federal mandates, and real-time income verification using third-party integrations such as Equifax. He manages these complex projects end-to-end across the full SDLC, working closely with state stakeholders, business analysts, and multidisciplinary technical teams.
 
Previously, Prasanth played a pivotal role in modernizing North Dakota’s SPACES portal—a citizen-facing eligibility system that streamlines benefit access for thousands across Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, and LIHEAP. He led the complete redesign of the 120-screen portal using human-centered design principles and successfully deployed a vendor interface platform with zero user acceptance defects, earning acclaim for its quality and usability.
 
Prasanth’s career began at Tech Mahindra, where he developed Java and Spring-based applications for energy management systems in the railroad sector, sharpening his engineering and system integration skills.
 
His core strengths include business-technology alignment, stakeholder engagement, agile delivery, and design-led implementation for large-scale public sector systems. He is also deeply versed in data analysis, eligibility logic, and regulatory compliance within the U.S. benefits landscape.
 
With a Bachelor of Technology from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Prasanth combines technical fluency with policy-driven thinking. His ability to deliver scalable, user-centric solutions has positioned him as a strategic leader in the modernization of social service delivery platforms.
