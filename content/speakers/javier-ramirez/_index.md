I help developers make the most of their (fast) data, I make sure the core team behind QuestDB listens to absolutely every piece of feedback I get, and I facilitate collaboration in our open source repository. 

I love data, big and small. I have extensive experience with SQL, NoSQL, graph, in-memory databases, Big Data, and Machine Learning. I like distributed, scalable, always-on systems. 

Before working in Developer Relations, I spent 20 years developing software professionally and sharing what I learnt with the community.
