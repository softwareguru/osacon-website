In this talk, I will introduce how Apache Doris, as a real-time analytical database, extends from custom-facing business scenarios to agent-facing ones.

I will cover the technical details behind high concurrency and low-latency query analytics, as well as capabilities supporting AI scenarios such as hybrid search, agent observability, and collaboration between Doris MCP Server and large language models (LLMs).

This will help the audience understand how Doris empowers enterprises to perform real-time data exploration in the AI era.
