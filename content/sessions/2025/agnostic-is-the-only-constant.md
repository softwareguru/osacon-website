As the Lakehouse paradigm rises in popularity, so does the risk of being locked into a single vendor's ecosystem. But what if you could have all the benefits of a unified architecture—without giving up control?
 
In this session, we introduce Lakekeeper, an open-source Apache Iceberg catalog that makes it possible to build Lakehouse architectures that are truly portable: across clouds, compute engines, and storage layers.
 
This talk speaks directly to data professionals looking to stay ahead of the curve by exploring:
 
How open formats like Iceberg and open catalogs like Lakekeeper can break down silos
 
How to build cloud-neutral, compute-agnostic analytics pipelines
 
Why metadata and catalogs are the new control plane for governance and orchestration
 
Real-world examples of Lakehouse deployments using Trino, Spark, and DuckDB
 
A vision for future-proofed architectures built entirely on open standards
 
Whether you're modernizing your stack or starting fresh, this session offers practical insight and fresh ideas for staying flexible, scalable, and free from lock-in — while staying fully open-source.
