As AI transforms how we build, scale, and interact with software, one thing is becoming clear: open source isn’t just keeping up—it’s leading. In this keynote, Max Beauchemin, creator of Apache Superset and Apache Airflow, unpacks why open source is uniquely positioned to dominate in the age of AI. From training data to developer velocity, open projects have structural advantages that proprietary vendors simply can't replicate.

We'll explore how LLMs ""know"" open source deeply, how AI-native workflows amplify OSS contributions, and why communities—not corporations—are becoming the new centers of gravity for software innovation. Whether you're a maintainer, contributor, or startup founder, this talk will reframe how you think about OSS and help you ride the wave instead of getting swamped by it.

The future of software is AI-native and open by default. Let’s talk about what that really means—and how.
