Observability (O11y) is the practice of collecting, analyzing and acting upon system telemetry to ensure optimum performance and reliability. It is a real-time use case that every tech-driven organization faces. However, the landscape of observability is rapidly changing driven by a number of factors:

• The adoption of OpenTelemetry (OTel) at the agent and collection layers
• The rise of disaggregated observability stacks, combining best-of-breed solutions for each layer, built on open source technologies
• The evolution of "Observability 2.0" which combines all types of telemetry into a single common data model
• The advent of AI within observability systems, and, conversely, the need for observability of AI systems

This talk will bring attendees up to speed on the rapidly changing observability landscape, and how data streaming, stream processing, and real-time analytics technologies play critical roles in emerging disaggregated observability stacks.
