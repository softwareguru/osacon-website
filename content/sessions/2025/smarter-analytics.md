What happens when databases don’t just store data—but help analyze it intelligently? This talk explores emerging trends in AI-powered database intelligence, from schema optimization and real-time query tuning to transforming unstructured content using techniques like sentiment analysis and entity recognition. We'll also dive into the future of self-driving databases and multi-modal analytics that integrate text, images, and more. Attendees will leave with a forward-looking view of how AI is reshaping database engines into context-aware, insight-generating platforms—laying the foundation for the next generation of open-source analytics systems.
