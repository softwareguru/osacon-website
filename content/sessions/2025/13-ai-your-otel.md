New employee onboarding often involves navigating a sea of information, which can delay full productivity. This session will explore how AI can personalize information discovery, helping new hires integrate more quickly and engage effectively.
 
We'll detail an architecture that uses OpenTelemetry to transmit metrics and Google's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolbox for Databases to connect AI agents with a high-performance ClickHouseÂ® data lake. This setup allows for dynamic, real-time access to relevant company knowledge.
 
Discover how to visualize these queries using modern dashboards like Grafana or Perses, creating an AI-enhanced system. The talk will cover strategies to improve new hire time-to-value and foster a more data-informed organizational culture.
