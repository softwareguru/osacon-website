Airport is a DuckDB community extension developed by Query.Farm that adds Apache Arrow Flight support to DuckDB.

In plain terms:
👉 It lets DuckDB query, modify, and store data through Arrow Flight servers — remote, high-performance data endpoints that speak gRPC and Arrow IPC.

You can think of it as “network tables for DuckDB.”
Instead of reading files from disk, you can query live data over the network just like local tables.
