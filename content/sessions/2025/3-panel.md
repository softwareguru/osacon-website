Open source thrives on passion â€” but it also takes more. This panel brings together leaders from across the ecosystem to explore how open-source projects can stay healthy, grow contributors, and even turn sustainability into profitability. From practical frameworks like the CHAOSS Practitioner Guides to lessons in building successful businesses around open code and data-driven insights from massive usage analytics, our panelists will share real-world tactics for keeping open source vibrant for the long term.
