Apache Iceberg™ made great advancements going from Table Format V1 to Table Format V2, introducing features like position deletes, advanced metrics, and cleaner metadata abstractions. But with Table Format V3 on the horizon, Iceberg users have even more to look forward to.
 
In this session, we’ll explore some of the exciting new user-facing features that V3 Iceberg is about to introduce and see how they’ll make working with Open Data Formats easier than ever! We’ll go through the high-level details of the new functionality that will be available in V3. Then we’ll dive deep into some of the most impactful features. You’ll learn what Variant types have to offer your semi-structured data, how Row Lineage can enhance CDC capabilities, and more. 
 
The community has come together to build yet another great release of the Iceberg spec, so attend and learn about all of the changes coming and how you can take advantage of them in your teams.
