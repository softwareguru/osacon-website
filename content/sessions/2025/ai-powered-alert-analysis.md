Manual analysis of thousands of daily database alerts is impossibleâ€”but AI changes everything. This talk demonstrates using modern AI tools to analyze internal alert databases and uncover critical patterns in ClickHouse Cloud deployments.
 
Through live demos, we'll show how to:
 
 1. Identify the most critical and common alert patterns using AI-assisted SQL generation
 
 2. Correlate application alerts with ClickHouse system tables (query_log, part_log, asynchronous_metric_log)
 
 3. Automate root cause analysis and predict alert escalation paths
 
 4. Transform raw alert data into actionable insights for proactive monitoring
 
See how combining ClickHouse's analytical power with AI tools creates a modern framework for database monitoring that prevents production outages before they happen.
