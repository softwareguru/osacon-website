Distributed systems are full of surprises—and ClickHouse® is no exception. In this talk, Shivji (Nutanix) and Anurag (Incerto) share real-world war room stories from designing, testing, and running ClickHouse® across both cloud and on-prem environments, where debugging production issues often felt more like unraveling plot twists in a thriller than routine operations.

We'll walk through some of the toughest incidents we've faced: what broke, what we thought was wrong, what actually was wrong, and how we got to the root cause. Along the way, we’ll introduce a practical framework for tackling such issues—combining human intuition, AI assistance, and the messy negotiations that often define real-world problem-solving.

Because in production, solutions aren’t always about perfect optimizations—they’re about trade-offs, context, and sometimes, knowing when to compromise.

Join us for a behind-the-scenes look into ClickHouse® in the wild—lessons learned, patterns observed, and a few fun battle scars.
