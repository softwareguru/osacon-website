I was fed up with FAQ search that spits back junk or nothing at all. TSIA says over sixty percent of support tickets could be solved by our own docs, so why isn’t that happening? In this talk I’ll show how I built a simple semantic search app with just three hundred lines of Python. I’ll demo it live answering three differently worded questions, and all in under a hundred milliseconds using TiDB Open-Source and Amazon Bedrock embeddings. At the end i'll provide the steps you need to take so you can clone the repo and run it on your docs tonight.
