This talk dives into technical optimizations that deliver low-latency, high-concurrency queries on Apache Iceberg without sacrificing openness. Together, we'll examine what kills performance when querying Iceberg, highlight best practices that make queries faster, and evaluate query engine optimizations for Icebergâ€”including handling position and equality delete tables, distributed metadata parsing, and more. You'll hear real-world stories from leading enterprises who have used these lessons to optimize Apache Iceberg performance at scale and walk away with actionable techniques for making your Iceberg lakehouse faster than ever.
